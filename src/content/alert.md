## Description

An alert (not to be confused with the [JavaScript `window.alert()` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert)) is a component for providing feedback to a user.

## Markup

```html
<div role="alert">
  That thing you just tried didn't work!
</div>
```

The role, "alert" is one of five special 'live region' roles. These make it possible to notify assistive technology when an elementâ€™s content changes, no matter what the user is currently focused on.

## Usage guidelines

Alerts, by definition, are disruptive. Lots of alerts at once or unnecessary alerts will create a bad user experience.[^1]
